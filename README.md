# Finder Partner Tag - Google Tag Manager Template

Please follow these instructions when installing the tag, and consult with your Finder client services team.

## 1. Landing Page tag
Create a new tag in Google Tag Manager using the Finder Partner Tag template, choosing "Landing Page" as the Tag Type. This tag needs to be installed either sitewide, or on all pages that are being used as landing pages for your partnership with Finder.

## 2. Conversion tag
Create a new tag in Google Tag Manager using the Finder Partner Tag template, choosing "Conversion" as the Tag Type. Enter your Offer ID as provided by your Finder client services team, and then choose a trigger so that the tag will fire when your main conversion event occurs (for example, a sale, a lead or an application).

Your Finder client services team will inform you if any of the other optional fields for the tag need to be populated.
