# Finder Partner Tag - Google Tag Manager Template

Share conversion data with Finder to enhance your campaign results and partnership effectiveness.

Please follow these instructions when installing the tag, and consult with your Finder Client Services and AdOps team. Note that:
- When this tag is installed on your website via Google Tag Manager, conversion data will be sent to Finder.
- You may need to update your website's privacy policy accordingly when installing this tag.

Finder partners will need to install both a landing page tag and a conversion tag on their website, as per the following instructions:

## 1. Landing Page tag
- Create a new tag in Google Tag Manager.
- Under "Tag configuration", select "Discover more tag types in the Community Template Gallery" and then choose the **Finder Partner Tag**.
- Choose "Landing Page" as the Tag Type.
- Under "Triggering", choose a trigger to fire the tag either sitewide, or on all pages that are being used as landing pages for your partnership with Finder.

## 2. Conversion tag
- Create a new tag in Google Tag Manager.
- Under "Tag configuration", select "Discover more tag types in the Community Template Gallery" and then choose the **Finder Partner Tag**.
- Choose "Conversion" as the Tag Type. Enter your Offer ID as provided by your Finder Client Services or AdOps team.
- Under "Triggering", choose a trigger so that the tag will fire when your main conversion event occurs (for example, a sale, a lead or an application).
- Your Finder team will inform you if any of the other optional fields for the conversion tag need to be populated.
